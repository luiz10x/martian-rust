> [!NOTE] This guide assumes that you have some familiarity with Rust and a basic understanding of [Traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait.html) and [associated types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/assoc_items/types.html)

Depending on your preferred learning style you might want to navigate through this guide differently. This page gives you an overview of the different items presented here.
